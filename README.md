# gif storage

Storage place for all my favorite gifs.

This repo is very inspired by [jglovier/gifs](https://github.com/jglovier/gifs)

I have added icons to copy of the links with one click, and plan to add one or two other feature.

## Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request if you think you got an awesome gif or two. I will only accept stuff that I would use myself.

This collection is _mine_ so the priority is to have gifs I like before anything else. That said, feel free to suggest new ones, even if I don't accept the PR you found your new favorite(s) gif(s) :tada:

## How do I get my own ?

You can fork [jglovier's](https://github.com/jglovier/gifs/fork) repo or [mine](https://github.com/le6barbare/gifs/fork). I modified the style/build script for my own usage.

Once you fork to your own account, you can even host your own GH Pages site ([like mine](http://gifs.le6barbare.me/)) by editing or removing the [CNAME](http://github.com/Le6barbare/gifs/blob/gh-pages/CNAME) file in your fork accordingly.

To update the site index, just run `./script/build.py` (you will need Python 3) in the folder of the repo, commit your changes to `gh-pages`, wait for GitHub's magic to take effect and _voil√† !_ :tophat:
